Glide is a cloud-native open source model gateway.

> [!Warning]
> Glide is under active development right now. Give us a star to support the project ✨

## Features

- Achieve high availability working with external model providers.
- Glide sits between your applications and your API endpoint. Pass your model preferences to the API endpoint and your call will be routed to the correct model based on model availability.
