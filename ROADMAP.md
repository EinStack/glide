# Glide Roadmap

Glide uses a Github project functionality to manage roadmap:

- [Glide's roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/EinStack/projects/1/views/4)

Please upvote or comment on issues that you would like to be implemented or solved in Glide. 
We pay attention to that information during prioritization.

Open [an issue](https://github.com/EinStack/glide/issues) or start [a discussion](https://github.com/EinStack/glide/discussions) if there is a feature, enhancement, or use case 
you'd like to see supported in Glide.
