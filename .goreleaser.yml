  # Repo in which the release will be created.

  # If set to true, will not auto-publish the release.
  # Available only for GitHub and Gitea.
  draft: true

  # Whether to remove existing draft releases with the same name before creating
  # a new one.
  # Only effective if `draft` is set to true.
  # Available only for GitHub.

  # Since: v1.11
  replace_existing_draft: true

  # Useful if you want to delay the creation of the tag in the remote.
  # You can create the tag locally, but not push it, and run GoReleaser.
  # It'll then set the `target_commitish` portion of the GitHub release to the
  # value of this field.
  # Only works on GitHub.

  # If set, will create a release discussion in the category specified.

  # Warning: do not use categories in the 'Announcement' format.

  # If set to auto, will mark the release as not ready for production
  # in case there is an indicator for this in the tag e.g. v1.0.0-rc1
  # If set to true, will mark the release as not ready for production.
  # Default is false.
  prerelease: auto

  # If set to false, will NOT mark the release as "latest".
  # This prevents it from being shown at the top of the release list,
  # and from being returned when calling https://api.github.com/repos/OWNER/REPO/releases/latest.

  # What to do with the release notes in case there the release already exists.
  #
  # Valid options are:
  # - `keep-existing`: keep the existing notes
  # - `append`: append the current release notes to the existing notes
  # - `prepend`: prepend the current release notes to the existing notes
  # - `replace`: replace existing notes
  #
  # Default is `keep-existing`.
  mode: append

  # You can change the name of the release.
  #
  # Default: '{{.Tag}}' ('{{.PrefixedTag}}' on Pro)
  # Templates: allowed
  name_template: "v{{.Version}}"

  # You can disable this pipe in order to not create the release on any SCM.
  # Keep in mind that this might also break things that depend on the release
  # URL, for instance, homebrew taps.
